# Project 1: Spotify and Popularity

As part of a group of 3, I analyzed a Spotify dataset from Kaggle and used principles learned in my Machine Learning class to study what characteristics and what levels of those characteristics contributed to songsâ€™ popularity ratings. Using an XGBoost Model and SHAP variable importance to reach our conclusions, we found that more recent songs are most popular with Spotify listeners, with most of those songs exhibiting low levels of acoustics, less lyrics, and high levels of "danceability".
