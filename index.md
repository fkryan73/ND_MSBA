## Introduction

Hello, my name is Kevin Ryan, and I am from southern New Jersey, right outside Philadelphia, PA. My journey in programming, data analysis, visualization, etc. started in August 2020 when I began my Master's program in Buisness Analytics at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana. My expected graduation date will be May 2021.

I will be constantly updating this repository as I move throughout the program to highlight some of the completed coursework and projects that I feel confident in enough to publish. I hope all enjoy.
