## Introduction

Hello, my name is Kevin Ryan, and I am from southern New Jersey, right outside Philadelphia, PA. My journey in programming, data analysis, etc. started August 2020 when I began my Master's program in Buisness Analytics at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana. My expected graduation date will be May 2021.

I will be constantly updating this repository as I move throughout the program to highlight some of the completed coursework and projects that I feel confident in enough to publish. I hope all enjoy.

## Projects

Machine Learning - Spotify and Popularity

- Analyzed a Spotify dataset from Kaggle and used principles learned in my Machine Learning class to study what characteristics and what levels of those characteristics contrinuted to songs' popularity ratings.

## An Aside

Like mentioned above, I am brand new to this world, and I know I am going to mess up royally even the most basic tasks, such as proper file upload. However, I want to learn as much as possible, so I am open to any and all discussion about anything data science & analytics related (even though I do not much). So if anyone has any critique or advice on what I publish or how I publish it, please reach out to discuss. I am all ears. Thank you for your help and considseration in advance.
